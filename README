This is my configuration for Awesome WM.

It is in continuos renoval, so, check it :)

Right now have:

Personalized tags.

Personalized Rules for programs

Clock & calendar widget

Battery widget

Up/down kb/s widget

Wifi widget

CPU usage widget

Volume widget!!!


Specials:
My configuration needs wicd, and xlock, if you want to use it full.

If you push Mod4+b, the screen locks.  (b --> block :P)

Left click in the volume widget, it opens alsamixer, and right click mute and umute.

Left click in Wifi widget will open wicd-client :)



Cheers!
